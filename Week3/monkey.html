                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder 
                        Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group 
                        now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, 
                        in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, 
                        if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
